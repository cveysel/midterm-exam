# Midterm Exam
This is my midterm exam project. The application is actually a recipe app where the details of a dish can be entered and saved, and then displayed on the splash screen. As an extra feature, I added a mini game. In the game, writing the mixed-up fruit names correctly earns points, and if written incorrectly, the points are reset to zero.
